# raycaster

Raycaster made in C++

#### Building

##### Unix-like

`$ https://github.com/YonniGashu/raycaster.git`\
`$ make libs`\
`$ make`

Running `$ make libs` will ensure that you have SDL2 installed.

It will also list out the flags that you should update in the CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS sections of the Makefile before running.

The game binary, once built with `$ make`, can be found in `./bin/`.

_Be sure_ to run with `$ ./bin/game` out of the root directory of the repository.

##### Windows

good luck 🤷🏾‍♂️
